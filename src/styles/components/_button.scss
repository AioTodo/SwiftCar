// Legacy BEM button styles have been deprecated in favor of Mantine-based
// Button components (see src/components/common/Button/Button.js).
// This file is intentionally left minimal to avoid conflicting with
// Mantine styles. If you need button layout tweaks, prefer targeting
// layout containers instead of the button element itself.
