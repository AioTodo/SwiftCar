## 3. Problem Statement

### 3.1 Problems for Small Car Rental Agencies

#### Limited Digital Presence

Small agencies rely primarily on walk-in customers, phone calls, or outdated websites, resulting in missed opportunities for over 70% of bookings that occur online. Without a professional digital presence, these agencies remain invisible to the majority of potential customers.

#### Inability to Compete with Corporations

Enterprise rental chains dominate search results on major platforms, leaving local agencies with virtually no online visibility. This creates an uneven playing field where smaller businesses cannot compete regardless of their service quality or pricing.

#### Prohibitive Platform Fees

Major booking platforms charge commission rates between 15-25%, making it financially unviable for small agencies to participate while maintaining competitive pricing. These high fees erode already thin profit margins.

#### Technical Complexity

Large platforms require API integrations, technical expertise, and IT infrastructure that small agencies lack the resources to implement. This technological barrier prevents them from accessing online markets.

#### Unpredictable Revenue

Dependence on seasonal walk-ins and word-of-mouth referrals creates volatile revenue streams, making it difficult for agencies to plan operations, manage inventory, or scale their businesses effectively.

#### Payment Processing Challenges

Small agencies struggle to implement secure online payment systems, leading to customer trust issues and lost bookings. The complexity of payment security standards is beyond many agencies' capabilities.

#### Credibility Gap

Tourists are hesitant to rent from unknown local agencies due to concerns about reliability, vehicle quality, and recourse if problems arise. This trust deficit costs agencies significant business.

### 3.2 Problems for Customers (Renters)

#### Limited Options

Major rental platforms exclusively feature large chains, hiding local alternatives that often offer better prices, personalized service, and unique vehicle options.

#### Trust and Safety Concerns

Customers worry about the legitimacy of local agencies, vehicle conditions, insurance coverage, and their ability to resolve disputes, leading them to choose expensive international brands purely for perceived safety.

#### Hidden Fees and Unclear Pricing

Many rental sites employ confusing pricing structures with surprise charges at pickup, creating customer frustration and eroding trust in the rental process.

#### Language Barriers

International tourists struggle to communicate with local agencies, leading to misunderstandings about rental terms, vehicle features, and booking details.

#### Poor Vehicle Information

Local agency websites often feature low-quality photos, incomplete specifications, and missing details, forcing customers to book blindly and risk disappointment.

#### Comparison Shopping Difficulty

Customers must navigate multiple agency websites, each with different formats and information structures, making price and feature comparison time-consuming and frustrating.

#### Booking Complexity

Some agencies still require phone calls, faxes, or complicated email exchanges to complete bookings, creating friction that leads to abandoned reservations.

### 3.3 Problems for the Tourism Ecosystem

#### Market Fragmentation

The car rental market operates inefficiently with customers unable to find agencies and agencies unable to reach customers, resulting in lost economic opportunities for entire communities.

#### Tourism Reputation Impact

Poor rental experiences damage overall tourism reputation through negative reviews and word-of-mouth, affecting all local businesses.

#### Economic Leakage

International rental chains extract profits from local economies, reducing the economic benefit of tourism for communities and limiting reinvestment in local infrastructure and services.
