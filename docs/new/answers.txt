        - Sequence Diagrams.
        - Activity Diagrams.

Q3: What's your technical stack?
if you have seen the files i sent you'll understand that i'm working only on the UI/UX with react only.
and, the tech stack is the following:
    A. Redax method:
        - React (Create React App - NOT Vite, NOT Next.js).
        - React Router DOM for navigation.
        - Styling & CSS Tech Stack:
            - **CSS Preprocessor:** Sass
            - **CSS Architecture:** BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
            - **Layout System:** CSS Grid & Flexbox
            - **Styling Foundation:** CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
            - **Core Principles:** Mobile-first responsive design
            - **Animation Approach:** Hardware-accelerated CSS properties
            - **Accessibility Standard:** WCAG guidelines compliance
            - **Design Philosophy:** Human-centered minimalism with 60/30/10 color rule
        - JSON files for mock data (no backend)
        - Local state management with useState and useContext and Redux.
    B. Without Redux Method: 
        Same as the Method A but the only change is the local state management with useState and useContext.
    C. With only props:
        No state managers like useState or useContext.
